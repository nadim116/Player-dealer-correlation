Theres was about 13  instances of fraud during the dates 03/10, 03/12 and 03/15. 
the losses ranged from -65k to aprroximately 182k.

Billy Jones was always the dealer during those times listed above. The player Mylie schmidt was present as well during all those times. 

I believe Billy Jones and Mylie Schidt colluded together since the data shows that there was always a significant loss during the times they were paired together.
